# Azure Data Engineering Project

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end data engineering solution using various Azure services. The main goal is to ingest data from an Azure SQL database, transform it, and visualize it through an interactive dashboard.

## Use Case
The project consists of the following steps:
1. **Data Ingestion**: Ingest tables from an on-premise SQL Server database using **Azure Data Factory**.
2. **Data Storage**: Store the ingested data in **Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2** for secure storage.
3. **Data Transformation**: Use **Azure Databricks** with PySpark to clean the raw data.
4. **Data Loading**: Load the cleaned data into **Azure Synapse Analytics**.
5. **Data Visualization**: Connect **Azure Synapse Analytics SQL** to **Microsoft Power BI** to create an interactive dashboard.
6. **Monitoring and Governance**: Use **Azure Key Vault** to securely store keys and passwords.

## Tools Used
- **Azure Data Factory**
- **Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2**
- **Azure Databricks**
- **Azure Synapse Analytics**
- **Azure Key Vault**
- **Microsoft Power BI**

## Project Focus
This project focused on learning and gaining hands-on experience with various Azure services.
